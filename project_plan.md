# Scramble Project Plan

## Intro

This is a static site website meant to be hosted on something like GitHub pages. It's a game written in HTML 5 and Typescript, and is meant to be played in a browser. The game is called "Scamble" and is a version of the popular boardgame Scrabble. It can be played only 2 player, locally, and one the same screen.

## Development Plan

* Create a game board that is 15x15 grid. 
* Create a row to hold the players 7 tiles.
* Using the `scrable_tiles.json`, randomly assign 7 tiles to player one.
* Allow the player to drag and drop a tile onto the game board.
